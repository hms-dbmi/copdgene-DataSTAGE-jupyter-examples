    "PIC-SURE is a an ecosystem designed to handle very large amounts of data in a secure way.  This reduces the administrative load on researchers and allows them to better focus on Data Science discoveries.  PIC-SURE is composed of two major parts: 1) the PIC-SURE framework which handles communication, security, auditing and other system tasks, and 2) Datasets which are also described as \"data resources within the PIC-SURE service\".  The PIC-SURE also allows some \"data wrangling\" on the server, easing the amount of energy required by a researcher to load, process, and trim the data down to the details needed to conduct research.\n",

Within a PIC-SURE instance exists one or more Datasources.  Each Datasources is of a specific type and are run using different server code.  For each type of Datasource there is a Datasource Adapter Library which is written specifically to communicate with it's particular type of Datasource.\n",
